# Breast_Cancer

This code is used to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not using variables such as clump thickness, cell size, nucleim mitoses

I perform exploratory data analysis, create correlation plot, build train and test datasets

Experiment with multiple machine learning models such as logistic regression, LGBM and Random Forest
